Title: Queueing networks and Markov chains analysis package for GNU Octave
Description: The queueing toolbox provides functions for queueing
 networks and Markov chains analysis. This package can be used
 to compute steady-state performance measures for open, closed and mixed
 networks with single or multiple job classes. Mean Valud Analysis (MVA),
 convolution, and various bounding techniques are implemented. Several
 transient and steady-state performance measures for discrete-
 and continuous-time Markov chains can  be computed (state occupancy 
 probabilities, mean time to absorption, time-averaged sojourn times).
